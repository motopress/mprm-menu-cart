This is a free extension to the [WordPress Food Menu plugin](https://motopress.com/products/restaurant-menu/) by MotoPress.

The [Restaurant Menu Cart addon](https://motopress.com/products/restaurant-menu-cart/) adds a traditional shopping cart icon to the navigation menu of your site, thus simplifying the online shopping experience on your restaurant or cafe website.

There are several variations of the shopping cart look:
* Show a cart icon, or just the number of items/prices.
* Display items only, price only, or both.
* Opt for showing it always, or only when items are added to the cart.
* Choose cart position in the site menu.

You can install the addon right from your WordPress dashboard: head to Restaurant Menu > Settings > Extensions > Menu Cart.
